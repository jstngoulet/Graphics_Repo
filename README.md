###Graphics Repository
>Hello and welcome to my graphics repository!

>Attached, you will find a plethora of documents I have created over the years as a developer, and as a part time employee with the City of Carlsbad. These documents vary in purpose and show my improvements since I have been designing.

####I am always interested in learning more!
>I am aware of the vast potential of proper document handling and creation. From successful marketing tools to internal use, documents must always look and feel professional. The documents I provide expect criticism as I know I am a beginner. All assistance learned will travel with me to my other projects both professional and personal.

###Purpose:
>My general purpose is simple: Learn as much as you can, while you can. There are many fields related to graphics design and I do not want to limit myself. From application development to marketing, I want my hand in every known bucket to always have an upper advantage.
